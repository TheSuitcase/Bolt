# Bolt

**This is not useable at the moment! Still in active development!**

## Goal
Make using gulp quick and easy without losing the power and api of gulp!

### Subgoals
- [ ] The use should be able to run multiple bolt/gulp instances beside each other.
- [ ] Build-in error handling
- [ ] Build-in watcher for file changes (including added, deleting files/directories)
