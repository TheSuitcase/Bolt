- [ ] The user should be able to run multiple Bolt/Gulp instances beside each other.

- [ ] The user should be able to use/extend Bolt just like Gulp.

**Error Handling**
- [ ] Build-in error handling

- [ ] OS Notification when enabled


**Cli**
- [ ] Interactive (run task when bolt is already running)
- [ ] Command: Open file on the last reported error (including line and character).
- [ ] Generate Bolt file

**OSX Application**
- [ ] Tray Application for quick and easy access or and full blown desktop app.
- [ ] Interactive and detailed notifications.
